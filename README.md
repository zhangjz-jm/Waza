## Why

Waza (技, わざ) is a Japanese martial arts term for technique: a move practiced until it becomes instinct.

A good engineer does not just write code. They think through requirements, review their own work, debug systematically, design interfaces that feel intentional, and read primary sources. They write clearly, and learn new domains by producing output, not consuming content.

AI makes you faster. It doesn't make you think more clearly, ship more carefully, or understand more deeply. Waza packages these habits into skills Claude can run.

## Skills

Each engineering habit gets a [Claude Code skill](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills). Type the slash command, Claude follows the playbook.

| Skill | When | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [`/think`](skills/think/SKILL.md) | Before building anything new | Challenges the problem, pressure-tests the design, validates architecture before any code is written. |
| [`/design`](skills/design/SKILL.md) | Building frontend interfaces | Produces distinctive UI with a committed aesthetic direction, not generic defaults. |
| [`/check`](skills/check/SKILL.md) | After a task, before merging | Reviews the diff, auto-fixes safe issues, blocks destructive commands via hooks, verifies with evidence. |
| [`/hunt`](skills/hunt/SKILL.md) | Any bug or unexpected behavior | Systematic debugging. Root cause confirmed before any fix is applied. |
| [`/write`](skills/write/SKILL.md) | Writing or editing prose | Rewrites prose to sound natural in Chinese and English. Cuts stiff, formulaic phrasing. |
| [`/learn`](skills/learn/SKILL.md) | Diving into an unfamiliar domain | Six-phase research workflow: collect, digest, outline, fill in, refine, then self-review and publish. |
| [`/read`](skills/read/SKILL.md) | Any URL or PDF | Fetches content as clean Markdown via proxy cascade script. Dedicated handlers for WeChat and Feishu. |
| [`/health`](skills/health/SKILL.md) | Auditing Claude Code setup | Checks CLAUDE.md, rules, skills, hooks, MCP, and behavior. Flags issues by severity. |

Each skill is a folder, not just a markdown file. Skills include reference docs, helper scripts, scoped hooks, and gotchas sections built from real project failures.

## Extras

**Statusline**

A minimal Claude Code statusline that shows only what matters: context window usage, 5-hour quota, and 7-day quota, each with the time remaining until reset.

<img src="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/k/y9/RUgevg.png" width="800" />

Color coding: green below 70%, yellow at 70-85%, red above 85% for context; blue, magenta, red for quota thresholds. No progress bars, no noise.

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tw93/Waza/main/scripts/setup-statusline.sh | bash
```

**English Coaching**

Working with AI in English just works better. The model thinks in English, most of the good resources are in English, and clear writing compounds over time.

Passive grammar correction on every reply. Claude flags mistakes with the pattern name so you learn why.

> 😇 it is not good to be read → it's hard to read (Unnatural phrasing)

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tw93/Waza/main/templates/coaching-en.md >> ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

## Install

**Claude Code:**

```bash
npx skills add tw93/Waza -a claude-code -g -y
```

**Other agents:** pick your agent interactively.

```bash
npx skills add tw93/Waza
```

Requires Node 18+. Skills are also available at `.agents/skills/` for agents that auto-discover from that path.

Install a single skill:

```bash
npx skills add tw93/Waza -a claude-code -s health -y
```

Replace `health` with any skill name.

**Compatibility:** Core instruction skills `/think`, `/hunt`, `/learn`, `/write`, `/design` run on any agent. Claude Code-specific features are skipped on other platforms: `/check` loses hook-based destructive command blocking and sub-agent reviewers; `/health` and `/read` lose their shell scripts for URL fetching and config auditing.

## Background

Tools like Superpowers and gstack are impressive, but they are heavy. Too many skills, too much configuration, too steep a learning curve for engineers who just want to get things done.

There's also a subtler problem. Every rule the author writes becomes a ceiling. The model can only do what the instructions say and can't go further. Waza goes the other direction. Each skill sets a clear goal and the constraints that matter, then steps back. As models improve, that restraint pays compound interest.

Eight skills for the habits that actually matter. Each does one thing, has a clear trigger, and stays out of the way. Not complete by design, just the right amount done well.

Built from patterns across real projects, refined through actual use. Every gotcha traces to a real failure: a wrong code path that took four rounds to find, a release posted before artifacts were uploaded, a server restarted eight times without reading the error. 30 days, 300+ sessions, 7 projects, 500 hours.

The `/health` skill is based on the six-layer framework described in [this post](https://tw93.fun/en/2026-03-12/claude.html).
