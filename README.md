A collection of [Claude Code skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) for everyday software work. Skills are slash commands (`/think`, `/check`, `/hunt`, ...) that give Claude a focused methodology for a specific task: you type the command, Claude follows the playbook. Eight skills covering requirements, architecture, code review, debugging, frontend design, reading, writing, and config health. No framework overhead, no telemetry.

## Skills

| Skill | Trigger | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/think` | Before building anything new | Challenges assumptions, explores scope from a CEO/founder perspective. Design-first gate: no code until design is approved. |
| `/look` | Before coding, after design | Architecture review: dependency graph, data flow, test coverage, performance. Opinionated recommendations. |
| `/check` | After a task, before merging | Code review with fix-first approach. Auto-fixes safe issues, batches judgment calls, verifies with evidence. |
| `/hunt` | Any bug or unexpected behavior | Systematic debugging. Root cause before any fix. Iron Law: no fixes without root cause investigation. |
| `/design` | Building frontend interfaces | Produces distinctive UI with a committed aesthetic direction. Avoids generic AI aesthetics. |
| `/read` | Any URL or PDF | Fetches content as clean Markdown. Routes WeChat to a dedicated script, everything else through a proxy cascade. |
| `/write` | Writing or editing prose | Enforces natural style for Chinese and English. Strips AI writing patterns. |
| `/health` | Config feels off | Audits Claude Code setup across six layers: CLAUDE.md, rules, skills, hooks, MCP, behavior. |

## Install

**Single skill (recommended for most users):**

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add tw93/waza
claude plugin install health@waza
```

Replace `health` with any skill name to install a different one.

**All skills via npx:**

```bash
npx skills add tw93/waza -g -y
```

**Local install (clone and symlink):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tw93/waza.git ~/www/waza
bash ~/www/waza/install.sh
```

## Background

Built from patterns accumulated across real projects. The `/health` skill is based on the six-layer framework described in [this post](https://tw93.fun/en/2026-03-12/claude.html).
