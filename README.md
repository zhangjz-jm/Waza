A collection of [Claude Code skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) for everyday software work. Skills are slash commands (`/think`, `/check`, `/hunt`, ...) that give Claude a focused methodology for a specific task: you type the command, Claude follows the playbook. Eight skills covering requirements and architecture, code review, debugging, frontend design, reading, writing, deep learning, and config health. No framework overhead, no telemetry.

## Skills

| Skill | Trigger | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/think` | Before building anything new | Challenges the problem, pressure-tests the design, validates architecture before any code is written. |
| `/check` | After a task, before merging | Code review with fix-first approach. Auto-fixes safe issues, batches judgment calls, verifies with evidence. |
| `/hunt` | Any bug or unexpected behavior | Systematic debugging. Root cause confirmed before any fix is applied. |
| `/design` | Building frontend interfaces | Produces distinctive UI with a committed aesthetic direction. Avoids generic AI aesthetics. |
| `/read` | Any URL or PDF | Fetches content as clean Markdown. Routes WeChat to a dedicated script, everything else through a proxy cascade. |
| `/write` | Writing or editing prose | Enforces natural style for Chinese and English. Strips AI writing patterns. |
| `/learn` | Diving into an unfamiliar domain | Six-phase process: collect sources, digest, outline, draft, refine with AI, self-review and publish. |
| `/health` | Config feels off | Audits Claude Code setup across six layers: CLAUDE.md, rules, skills, hooks, MCP, behavior. |

## Install

**Single skill (recommended for most users):**

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add tw93/waza
claude plugin install health@waza
```

Replace `health` with any skill name to install a different one.

**All skills via npx:**

```bash
npx skills add tw93/waza -g -y
```

**Local install (clone and symlink):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tw93/waza.git ~/www/waza
bash ~/www/waza/install.sh
```

## Background

Built from patterns accumulated across real projects. The `/health` skill is based on the six-layer framework described in [this post](https://tw93.fun/en/2026-03-12/claude.html).
