# Check: Review Before You Ship

Read the diff, find the problems, fix what can be fixed safely, ask about the rest. Do not claim done until verification has run in this session.

## Get the Diff

```bash
git fetch origin
git diff origin/$(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo main)
```

Already on the base branch? Stop and ask which commits to review.

## Did We Build What Was Asked?

Before reading the code, check for scope drift:
- Pull up recent commit messages and any task files
- Does the diff match the stated goal? Flag anything outside that scope: unrelated files, voluntary additions, missing requirements
- Label it: **on target** / **drift** / **incomplete** and note it, but do not block on it

## What to Look For

### Hard stops (fix before merging)

These are not negotiable:

- **Injection and validation**: SQL, command, path injection; inputs that bypass validation at system entry points
- **Shared state**: unsynchronized writes, check-then-act races, missing locks
- **External trust**: output from LLMs, APIs, or user input fed into commands or queries without sanitization; credentials hardcoded or logged
- **Missing cases**: enum or match exhaustiveness; use grep on sibling values outside the diff to confirm

### Soft signals (flag, do not block)

Worth noting but not merge-blocking:

- Side effects that are not obvious from the function signature
- Magic literals that should be named constants
- Dead code, stale comments, style gaps relative to the surrounding code
- Untested new paths
- Loop queries, missing indexes, unbounded growth

## How to Handle Findings

Fix directly when the correct answer is unambiguous: clear bugs, null checks on crash paths, style inconsistencies matching the surrounding code, trivial test additions.

Batch everything else into a single AskUserQuestion when the fix involves behavior changes, architectural choices, or anything where "right" depends on intent:

```
[N items need a decision]

1. [hard stop / signal] What: ... Suggested fix: ... Keep / Skip?
2. ...
```

## Regression Coverage

For every new code path: trace it, check if a test covers it. If this change fixes a bug, a test that fails on the old code must exist before this is done.

## Verification

After all fixes are applied, run the project's own verification command:

```bash
cargo check && cargo test   # Rust
make test / npm test / pytest  # everything else
```

Paste the full output. Report exact numbers. Done means: the command ran in this session and passed.

If the urge to skip this arises: "should work now" means run it. "I'm confident" is not evidence. "It's a trivial change" is how trivial changes break things.

## Sign-off

```
files changed:    N (+X -Y)
scope:            on target / drift: [what]
hard stops:       N found, N fixed, N deferred
signals:          N noted
new tests:        N
verification:     [command] → pass / fail
```
